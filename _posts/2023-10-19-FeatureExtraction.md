#### Feature Extraction
Feature extraction is a vital process in the deep learning pipeline. It is all about transforming the raw data into a set of features or attributes that can be used to train neural networks effectively. These features capture the essence of the data while reducing its dimensionality, making it more manageable for the neural network to process. By understanding and mastering feature extraction, you will be better equipped to design neural networks that can quickly and accurately learn from the data.
