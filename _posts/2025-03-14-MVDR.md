# Wideband MVDR Beamformer based Ultrasound Image Reconstruction

In pulse-echo ultrasound imaging, the conventional reconstruction algorithm is the "Delay-and-Sum (DAS) Beamformer ", 
which adjusts the delay of each channel to align pulse echoes returning from each scatterer. However, the DAS beamformer 
does not aim to reduce noise and interference components on the received data of each channel but focuses the beam on each 
single candidate pixel point. The Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) beamformer goes beyond the basic DAS approach 
by optimizing the weights applied to the received data of each channel to achieve better performance in terms of signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR) and interference suppression. In this task, it is asked to implement a wideband MVDR beamformer by completing the following steps.  

### Implementation Steps 
1. **Presteering:** MVDR beamformer needs the wavefront of the pulse echo responses to be a plane wave, which is not the case in near-field ultrasound imaging. 
However, applying the appropriate delays, focusing each received signal to the candidate pixel as in the DAS beamformer, the plane wave, which is parallel to the transducer surface, can be created.  

2. **Division of Received Data into Subchannels:** The second assumption of the MVDR beamformer is the narrowband assumption, which assumes that the envelope of returning 
signals does not vary as much as the center sinusoidal. Considering that the incoming wave has a planar wavefront, it ensures that the only varying parameter between recorded signals 
in the adjacent transducer elements is the phase difference. However, wideband signals are conventionally emitted in ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the wideband signals should be divided
 into subchannels to comply with the narrowband assumption.  

3. **Spatial Covariance Matrix with Spatial Smoothing:** The spatial covariance matrix of each subchannel data in each transducer element should be calculated in the frequency domain. 
In calculation, spatial smoothing should be applied, which involves dividing the array into P overlapping subarrays and averaging the covariance matrix over these subarrays.  

4. **Calculation of MVDR beamformer weights and reconstruction:** MVDR beamformer weights should be calculated by applying the formula asking for steering vector and 
sample covariance matrix calculated in the previous step. The steering vector should be all one vector since the presteering stage ensured that the incoming wave is 
parallel to the surface of the transducer. After applying weights to each subchannel, the results should be summed up for all subchannels. MVDR beamforming can be 
realized by summing up weighted received signals across all received channels. The inverse FFT of the resulting vector gives the beamformed time-domain output signal. 
The reconstruction for the candidate point can be realized by summing up all elements of the beamformed signal.  

5. **Image Reconstruction:** The initial 4 steps should be repeated for each candidate pixel point in the measurement area to reconstruct the ultrasound image.
