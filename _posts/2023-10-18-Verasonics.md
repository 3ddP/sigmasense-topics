### Description
Ultrasound non-destructive testing (UNDT) is based on the process of transmitting ultrasound signals into an object under test, recording the reflected signals, and using them to learn about the internal structure of the object. Since the practical implementation of imaging and reconstruction algorithms involves large amounts of measurement data and necessitates great computational efforts, key questions arise, such as: How should the data be measured? How much data is needed to produce good reconstructions? How should the data be processed? During your time with us, you will have the opportunity to gain an understanding of ultrasound imaging systems through the practical application of different measurement schemes and image reconstruction methods on our Verasonics Vantage measurement system.

The Verasonics system is a powerful programmable ultrasound imaging system. It is used for research and development of new ultrasound imaging methods. You will work with the collecting of ultrasound measurements. With Matlab, you'll be programming the Verasonics system to specify custom data acquisition schemes.

There is also the opportunity to work in our research group in the long term, e.g. HiWi contracts, bachelor/master theses.

### Requirements
* Mandatory:
  * Matlab knowledge, as the Verasonics Vantage system is controlled and configured with Matlab. The tasks are therefore primarily focused on Matlab programming.
  * familiarity with or at least interest in ultrasound
  * familiarity with linear algebra: matrix-vectors operations and their implementations in Matlab
  * familiarity with basic signal processing concepts: Fourier transform, convolution, filtering, etc.
* Nice to have:
  * Python knowledge or interest in Python programming
  * familiarity with some software development tools, such as Git or unittest
  * familiarity with ultrasound

### Main Tasks
* familiarizing yourself with the Verasonics system, its documentation and tutorials
* reproducing the example code shipped with the system (with Matlab)
* implement a custom data acquisition scheme

### Team
You'll be working in an international team of researchers and PhD students. The team is very open, friendly, and values collaboration. We are always open to questions, ideas, discussions, and feedback. You will have the opportunity to put your ideas and technical knowledge into practice by working with state-of-the-art ultrasound hardware.
