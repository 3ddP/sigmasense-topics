Laser beam welding has gained increasing popularity in high volume manufacturing, such as in the automotive and aerospace industries. To detect weld failures in the early stage of production lines, in-process inspection is desirable. A cost-effective and promising inspection method is acoustic process monitoring. With acoustic process monitoring, we seek to gain the information relevant to both the weld and the process quality only from the acoustic process emissions. This poses a challenge, since not only the process relevant signals cannot be directly measured but also there are unobservable factors which affect both the weld and the signal quality.  
In this project it is investigated whether transforming and clustering the measurement data provides more insights on the correlation between the welding process and its acoustic emission. As the measurement quality fluctuates, it is also desired to quantify the uncertainty of each recording segment.
