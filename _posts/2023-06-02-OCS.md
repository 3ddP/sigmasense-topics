### Background
Compressed Sensing (CS) is a signal processing technique that allows the reconstruction of a sparse or compressible signal from a small number of acquired measurements, enabling efficient data acquisition and compression. Instead of randomly sampling in frequency domain, it is significant to deduce a determinant optimal subsampling pattern. Recently, softmax deep neural networks were shown to provide a feasible approach for solving such problems. 

### Task
- Conduct an extensive literature review on optimal Fourier sampling techniques and model-based deep learning methodologies.
- Replicate the JSR algorithm as outlined in the provided reference.
- Construct a Gumbel-Softmax or Softmax neural network architecture specifically designed for signal recovery purposes.
- Generate synthetic data sets and employ them to train the network with the aim of achieving optimal compressed sensing patterns in the frequency domain.
