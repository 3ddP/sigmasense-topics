### Background
In many real-world applications, high-performance computational imaging from incomplete or compressed measurements plays a crucial role. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for computational imaging, offering data-driven reconstruction methods that can learn optimal priors and enhance image quality beyond traditional approaches. This project focuses on developing deep learning-based reconstruction models, particularly using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net, to recover high-fidelity ultrasound images from compressed data.

### Task
- Literature review on deep learning-based denoising and reconstruction methods.
- Implement a deep neural network architecture and train the model on simulated and/or experimental ultrasound data.
- Evaluate algorithm performance using appropriate metrics, compare with SOTA/baseline algorithms, and perform the ablation analysis.
