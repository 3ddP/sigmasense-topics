### Background
Compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that allows the reconstruction of a sparse or compressible signal from a small number of acquired measurements, enabling efficient data acquisition directly during the measurement process. Compression matrices tailored to a specific task can offer better performance than random ones. Recently, softmax neural networks have been shown to provide a feasible approach for the design of compression matrices that perform subsampling, an otherwise difficult combinatorial problem.

### Task
- Literature research in frequency subsampling, deep unfoldings, and softmax neural networks
- Design of a task-based softmax neural network architecture that learns subsampling matrices
- Training and testing of the network when applied to frequency bin subsampling of synthetic ultrasound NDT data
