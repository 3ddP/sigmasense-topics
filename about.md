Hello! This is where the SigMaSense team keeps a list of research topics for students. If you're interested in doing research with us, drop us an email at **WIP**. Also, check out our [blog](https://3ddp.github.io/sigmasense/) if you have a few minutes to burn.

This blog uses the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The comments are handled via Github issues as explained [here](https://dc25.github.io/myBlog/2017/06/24/using-github-comments-in-a-jekyll-blog.html) and [here](https://github.com/dc25/minimaWithGithubComments).
